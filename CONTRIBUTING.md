# Contributing

The bar for contributions is the same bar the template sets for the projects
built from it.

## Before you open a PR

- Run the checks CI runs - `scripts/lint` and `scripts/test`; the pre-push
  hook runs both on every push.
- Cover new or changed behavior with a test - CI enforces the coverage
  threshold set in `[tool.coverage.report]` in `pyproject.toml`.
- Update the docs when commands or setup steps change.

## Ground rules

- Dependencies are declared once and locked: python in `pyproject.toml` +
  `uv.lock`, npm tools in `package.json` + `package-lock.json`. Never add an
  unlocked install step.
- GitHub Actions stay pinned to commit SHAs, Docker base images to digests -
  Dependabot keeps the pins current.
- `main` only takes pull requests with green `lint` and `test` checks.
