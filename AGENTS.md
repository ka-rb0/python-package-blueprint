# Python Package Blueprint - Agent Notes

## Safety check - read this first

Before doing anything else, verify that you are inside the project's dev
container: the repo is mounted at `/workspace` and `/.dockerenv` exists.
If either check fails, you are running directly on the host machine - stop
immediately, do not read or modify anything, and tell the user to reopen
the project in the dev container.

## Background

You are in a dev container - do as you please. Just make sure that anything
you change without permission stays inside the container. The container is
ephemeral, so any changes outside `/workspace` may be lost on a rebuild!

## What this is

A Python package blueprint.
See [README.md](README.md) for the full feature description.
